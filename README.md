Personal Docker notes, that I would like to share, to help someone out.
---

All notes are from freecodecamp YouTube video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo\&t=1458s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo\&t=1458s)&#x20;

If you are more of a note personality like me, rather than having to play the video all the time, i believe these notes will help you out.
